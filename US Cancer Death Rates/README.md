This is a capstone project from my data science intensive course. I execute the entire data science workflow to go from raw data to the final model.

A good starting point will be the Final Report. In the report, I lay out the reasons for creating the model and go into technical details of going through the data science workflow.

The Final Presentation gives more data visualizations and story telling for the project. It is geared for executive level audiences.

The Model Metrics is just a spreadsheet summary of the evaluation metrics realized when trying different ML models.

The code is divided into 4 sections to reflect the data science workflow. The order is:
Data Wrangling
EDA
Preprocessing
Modeling

The data is found in the cancer_rev.csv file.
