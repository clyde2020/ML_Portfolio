# ML_Portfolio
Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio! These projects are designed to showcase my machine learning abilities with Python and Tensorflow.

The projects include:

    -Cassava leaf disease classification

    -Satellite image interpretation

    -Histopathologic cancer detection

    -Titanic survivors
    
    -US Cancer Death Rates

The first 3 are image classification projects which focus on maximizing accuracy with regards to validation and test sets. 

The fourth is data which needs to be cleaned and processed before it can be fed through classifiers. The goal is to maximize accuracy of predicting survivors from the test set.

These 4 projects can be run on Google Colab and datasets can be downloaded from Kaggle.

The 5th project is a capstone project from my data science intensive course. This project exhibits each step of the data science workflow to show how we go from raw data to a finished model.

Please view the README file in each project folder for more specifics.
