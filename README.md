# ML_Portfolio
Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio! These projects are designed to showcase my machine learning abilities with Python and Tensorflow.

The projects include:

    -Cassava leaf disease classification

    -Satellite image interpretation

    -Histopathologic cancer detection

    -Titanic survivors

The first 3 are image classification projects which focus on maximizing accuracy with regards to validation and test sets. 

The fourth is data which needs to be cleaned and processed before it can be fed through classifiers. The goal is to maximize accuracy of predicting survivors from the test set.

All projects can be run on Google Colab and all datasets can be downloaded from Kaggle.

Please view the README file in each project folder for more specifics.
